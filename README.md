Project Goal One: Create a pricepoint for instagram shoutouts

Steps
  - Find 100 accounts that have 100k+ followers and are willing to promote Sweatcoin (an app that pays for specific Instagram accounts that promote users to download their app)
  - List each of these accounts in a json or text file that allows script to iterate through each one
  - Create line that defines how much an account charges vs follow count vs (average likes/follows)
  - Pay accounts to see what variables result in more downloads
  - Use this data to scrape specific Instagram accounts to generate the most revenue
  
Project Goal Two: Create a way to automatically post on multiple accounts based on the posts that similar accounts their niche are posting
